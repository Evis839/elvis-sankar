 <h2> WHO IS ELVIS SANKARA</h2>
 <h3> _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
 <p2>Hello, my name is Elvis SANKARA.
    I was born on October 29, 2004, in Bobo-Dioulasso. I am a 21-year-old student, currently specializing in computer engineering ‚Äî a field I‚Äôm truly passionate about.
    I‚Äôm proudly 100% Burkinab√®, originally from Nanoro, a village located near Koudougou. I come from a polygamous family of four children (two girls and two boys), and I deeply value my family roots. My mother‚Äôs name is Natacha SOME and my father is H√¢te SANKARA.
    
    Academically, I hold three diplomas: the CEP, the BEPC, and the BAC. I am currently pursuing my university studies at Aube Nouvelle University in Bobo-Dioulasso, with the goal of earning a doctorate in computer engineering.
    
    On a personal level, I would describe myself as kind, optimistic, and philanthropic. I enjoy spending time with friends and sharing good laughs.
    My favorite color is blue, which symbolizes calm and clarity, and my favorite dish is green beans ‚Äî simple but delicious.
    
    Welcome to my portfolio, and thank you for taking the time to get to know me. üôè
